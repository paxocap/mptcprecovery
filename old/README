This is version 1.6 of Javis, quite probably the final version. What you
have in this package is the complete Java source code.

Requirements:
	- JDK 1.1.7

Note that JNS will quite probably work with the JDK 1.2 without changes
(although that has not been tested).


An Overview
-----------

The source code for JNS is contained in the jns/ subdirectory. Everything in
the top level directory is just test files.

In doc/ you will find the documentation, in various formats. All the formats
have been built automatically from the SGML documents in doc/sgml.

You may safely ignore all the Test*.java files. The interesting files are
the Test_*.java files (please ignore the fact that the first wildcard would
match everything :)



Compiling JNS
-------------

It is easiest to compile JNS by compiling one of the test files.
Test_GoBackN shows off a simple transport protocol with hardcoded window
size four. Type:
	
	javac Test_GoBackN.java

That will compile everything. If you want you can make a 'jar' file and
delete all the sources and classes. In UNIX, type:

	jar cf0 jns.jar `find -name "*.class" | xargs`

There are a few settings in JNS that you might want to change, so have a
look around jns.util.Preferences if you are sure of yourself.


Running an Example
------------------

For a quick start, simply run the Test_GoBackN example. It will show you
some data transfer using the SGN protocol we wrote:

	java Test_GoBackN

This will produce a trace file called test_gobackn.jvs which you can look at
in Javis or NAM. You will see the three-way handshake and some data
transfer.

That's it. Enjoy JNS. And read the documentation :)
